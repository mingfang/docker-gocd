2.2. "Product" shall mean the computer programs, that are provided by Licensee to Licensee customers or potential customers, and that contain both the Software Program as a component of the Product, and a component or components (other than the Software Program) that provide the material functionality of the Product.

Licensee agree that Licensee will not, nor will Licensee authorize or license another to, sell, market or license the Software Program, or any portion thereof, as a standalone computer software program, component or software development tool, or as a component or components of a computer software program, the chief marketability and functionality of which is the Software Program.  Licensee further agree that Licensee will not publish, present or document the application programming interface (API) of the Software Program except as required for specific use within the Product.

A copy of this license must be distributed in full with the Product in a location that is obvious to Licensee customers.

Section 6 - Warranty and Limited Liability

Software Warranty: TSI warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days from the initial delivery of the software to Licensee, the Software, if used by Licensee in accordance with the Documentation, shall operate in material conformity with the Documentation for such Software. TSI does not warrant that the Software will meet all of Licensee requirements or that the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free. TSI's entire liability, and Licensee exclusive remedy, under this limited Software Warranty shall be for TSI (i) to attempt, through reasonable efforts, to correct any reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the ninety (90) day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software with Software which conforms to the foregoing warranty. In the event TSI is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in (i) and (ii) above, Licensee may return the Software and TSI shall refund any license and maintenance fees paid by Licensee to TSI for the Software. The above remedies are available only if TSI is promptly notified in writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the nonconformity by Licensee and TSI's examination of the Software discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software has not been (i) altered or modified, other than by TSI, (ii) subjected to negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions, or (iii) used, adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the Documentation.  Maintenance Services and Other Services Warranty: TSI warrants that any Maintenance Services or other Services performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards. TSI's entire liability and Licensee exclusive remedy under this limited Maintenance Services and Other Services Warranty shall be for Licensee to recover the fees paid for such nonconforming services

Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, AND TSI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability: EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS MADE UNDER SECTION 7 (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR DUE TO TSI HEREUNDER. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

Warranty Claims: Any claims made by Licensee for the breach of a warranty set forth in this Section 6, shall be made in writing and delivered in writing to TSI, and Licensee shall provide TSI a reproducible test case, if applicable, demonstrating the breach of warranty.


Section 7 - Indemnification

TSI warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software Program(s), or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will not infringe any copyright or patent, or other intellectual property rights of any third party, and TSI has all rights necessary for the grant of the rights and licenses granted by this Agreement. TSI agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs, liabilities, reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) and damages (collectively, a "Loss" or "Losses") arising from any claim that the Software Program infringes any copyright or patent, or other intellectual property right of a third party, provided, however:
(1) Licensee shall promptly deliver to TSI notice in writing of any claim for recovery under this section, and, if known, specify in reasonable detail the nature of the Loss and the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of the liability arising there-from. Licensee shall, at TSI's expense, provide to TSI as promptly as practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably requested by TSI to support and verify the claim assert-ed, provided that, in so doing, it may restrict or condition any disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance in any foreseeable litigation.
(2) If the facts pertaining to the Loss arise out of the claim of a third party, or if there is any claim against a third party available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, TSI shall assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense. Licensee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by TSI in any such action and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by Licensee shall be at Licensee expense.  TSI shall have the right to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by Licensee, to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable discretion. TSI shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not TSI chooses to so defend or prosecute such claim, Licensee and TSI shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
(3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely to arise, Licensee agree to allow TSI, at TSI's option, to either (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it be-comes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance; or (iii) as its sole obligation, terminate the license for the infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by Licensee, refund the unearned portion of any license fees paid by Licensee for the remainder of the current term hereof.
(4) TSI shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of infringement resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or data not supplied by TSI if such infringement would have been avoided by use of the Software Program alone. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that these four items are the exclusive remedy of Licensee for damages for breach of warranty or representations contained in this Section 7.


Section 8 - Termination

Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this Agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if effected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensee will either return to TSI or destroy all copies of the Software Program and documentation then in your possession.  Licenses to the Software Program granted in the normal course of business by Licensee to your customers shall survive termination of this Agreement.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of such termination furnish TSI with a certificate of compliance in accordance with this Section.  The parties agree that TSI shall have the right to enforce the obligations arising under this Section by seeking specific performance and to enjoin or compel Licensee through injunctive relief. Licensee may retain a commercially reasonable number of copies of the Software Program and documentation solely for the purpose of supporting Licensee customers.


Section 9 - Export Controls

Licensee shall comply with, and request of and/or notify Licensee sublicensees and resellers that they comply with, all applicable laws, regulations, rulings and executive orders of Japan relating to the export and re-export of Products containing the Software Program. Licensee shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export any Products containing the Software Program unless Licensee have obtained a license to do so if such a license is required.


Section 10 - Entire Agreement

This Agreement, including any attachments, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged herein.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement or any provision or attachment of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.


Section 11 - Governing Law

The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the substantive laws of  Japan (excluding conflicts of law principles).  Each party hereto expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts. If any legal action is undertaken to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.


Section 12 - Assignment and Benefit

Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may assign this Agreement; provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respective corporation or a corporation in which the shareholders of the respective corporation own a majority interest of the voting control provided that the assigning party remains obligated hereunder; further provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign this Agreement to another corporation which acquires or has acquired substantially all of the stock or assets of the assignor so long as, if the assignor is Licensee, the assignee's license to use the Software Program is limited to use in Products which were offered by Licensee to Licensee customers or potential customers and the assignee is prohibited from use of the Software Program in other products or parts of products developed, sold or distributed by the assignee.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of Licensee and TSI and each party's successors, subject to the other provisions of this Section.
